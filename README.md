# Introduction-to-Python
This was the first program I created in python in my first year in university 
it has very basic fuctions for a first project.

  Prog1.py shows setting up defining fuctions and parameters as well as using variables for when fuctions are being run.

  prog2.py is all about combining names and multiplying integers
  
  prog3.py is showing how basic loops work and if it should keep looping if the incorrect infomation is entered or not.
  
  Prog4.py is more math based and shows how to calculate the perimeter and area of a rectangle.
  
  all of them are commented if you want to take a look at how they work.
